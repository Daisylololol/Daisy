  <h1>Xia Dynasty vs Métis Nation</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Xia Dynasty</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Xia_dynasty_map.svg/640px-Xia_dynasty_map.svg.png" alt="Xia Dynasty map">
    <p>The Xia Dynasty was one of the earliest known dynasties in ancient China, around 2070 to 1600 BCE. It is known mostly from legends and ancient writings. The Xia people lived along the Yellow River in northern China, where farming and village life began to grow. They built small towns and started using bronze tools and simple irrigation systems.</p>
    <p>Their philosophy was based on harmony, respect for nature, and the belief that leaders should be fair and care for their people. They focused on balance and good morals. A main idea was that rulers had to earn the trust of the heavens and their people — this became known as the “Mandate of Heaven.”</p>
    <p><strong>Good parts:</strong> encouraged fairness, respect, and order in society.<br>
       <strong>Bad parts:</strong> it gave rulers too much power and sometimes people couldn’t question unfair leaders because they were seen as chosen by the gods.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Métis Nation</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Metis_Flag.svg/640px-Metis_Flag.svg.png" alt="Métis flag">
    <p>The Métis Nation formed in Canada during the 1700s and 1800s. The Métis people are of mixed Indigenous and European ancestry, and they developed their own language (Michif), clothing styles, and traditions. They mainly lived in areas that are now Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and parts of the northern United States.</p>
    <p>Their philosophy focused on community, equality, and connection to the land. They valued freedom and working together as a group. Métis families often lived by hunting, trading, and farming, sharing resources among everyone. They believed all people and nature were connected and deserved respect.</p>
    <p><strong>Good parts:</strong> taught cooperation, equality, and pride in cultural identity.<br>
       <strong>Bad parts:</strong> when outsiders didn’t respect their ways, it caused conflict, and sometimes traditions were lost because of colonization and discrimination.</p>

    <div class="compare">
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Xia Dynasty</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ancient China (around 2000 BCE)</li>
          <li>Lived near the Yellow River</li>

          <li>Started early forms of organized government</li>
          <li>Strong belief in order and respect</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Métis Nation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Canada (1700s and later)</li>
          <li>Lived in prairies and river regions</li>
          <li>Focused on freedom and community</li>
          <li>Respected nature and balance with the land</li>
          <li>Believed in equality and teamwork</li>
          <li>Fought for rights and cultural survival</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Even though the Xia Dynasty and the Métis Nation lived thousands of years apart and in totally different parts of the world, both cared deeply about harmony, community, and balance with nature. The Xia showed how early government and leadership ideas formed, while the Métis showed how community strength and equality could guide a culture.</p>
